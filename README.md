# New Constructs Python Engineer Code Exercise

* SOLUTION by SHANE KAMAR

## 1. APPROACH

My approach to this problem was first to download the appropriate URL, parse the HTML into plain-text using the html2text library (whose output claims to be valid Markdown as well, for further readability). Then, each character in the text was looped-through, scanning for the sentinel character ("$") and remembering the starting and ending character index of each paragraph. The paragraphs found to contain a "$" were added to a list of dictionaries of starting/ending positions as well as the text for each paragraph.

## 2. TIME SPENT

Approximately two hours were spent developing this solution.

## 3. LIBRARIES

html2text 2015.6.21
urllib (builtin)
json   (builtin)

## 3. RUNNING

The solution.py file contains a shebang that uses "/usr/bin/env python3.4", so the file should be easily executed directly from most unix environments. The solution can otherwise be run by executing "python3.4 solution.py".

## 4. OUTPUT

The files "document.txt" and "paragraphs.txt" are included in this repository, and are generated by the python script in whichever directory it is run.
